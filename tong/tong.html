<h4 id="orgd37ddea"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.1</span> Ways of being</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Being-for-itself:</i> The conscious life that humans have.
<ul>
<li>The consciousness, which is not a thing but still is.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><i>Being-in-itself:</i> The material, animal-like humans have.
<ul>
<li>The body, which can be accessed and works like an object.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><i>Being-for-others:</i> a mode of being in relation to other for-itselfs.
<ul>
<li>It implies a state of conflict, as establishing oneself as a self implies making everyone else an object.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-orgd842bdc">
<h4 id="orgd842bdc"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.2</span> Freedom is a curse</h4>
<ul>
<li><i>We are condemned to be free:</i>
<ul>
<li>That's why we have the <i>human condition</i>, not a <i>human essence</i>.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>We are born being nothingness, and through election we define ourselves (eliminating possibilities).</li>
<li>We thus tend to have <i>bad faith:</i>
<ul>
<li>We try to escape this state of freedom by imitating objects and just being a role (e. g. a waiter, ignoring someone is taking my hand).</li>

</ul></li>
<li>But this bad faith has two problems:
<ul>
<li>The for-itself can never become the in-itself (unless it dies).</li>
<li>Bad faith tries to avoid responsibility, which is what makes our freedom meaningful.</li>

</ul></li>

<h4 id="org8e9ad0c"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.3</span> Existence's  infinite [-ish] cycle of misery</h4>
<ul>
<li>Being-for-others and it's manifestations are useful concepts for feminist thought:
<ul>
<li><b><i>Love:</i></b> we desire to be both ourselves and the other, but we end up rejecting our subjectivity and trying to become objects for the other (masochism).</li>
<li><b><i>Indifference:</i></b> we try to ignore other people (as if they did not exist or could not determine us), until someone else irrupts in our life.</li>
<li><b><i>Desire:</i></b> we try to reduce the other to it's flesh, so that we can make sexual use of it, but when we achieve that we realize we wanted it as a subject (sadism).</li>
<li><b><i>Hate:</i></b> when the other does not submit to us as subject, and thus we feel ridiculed or vilified in the other's eyes, we want to destroy them all.</li>

<h4 id="org7227731"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.1</span> Men as <i>self</i>, women as <i>other</i></h4>
<ul>
<li>For men to be <i>selves</i>, they have to subjugate the <i>other</i>, which are women.
<ul>
<li>This relations is particular in it's universality and in being internalized by women.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Facts must be interpreted:
<ul>
<li><i><b>Biology</b></i>: The fact that women might be weaker/more passive than men biologically does not justify reducing them to an <i>in-itself</i>.</li>
<li><i><b>Psychoanalysis</b></i>: Even though sexuality is an important factor for human beings, women's subjugation is not due to their lack of male genitalia.</li>
<li><i><b>Marxism</b></i>: The fact that women's traditional labor is not recognized is irrelevant compared with men's tendency to dominate the other.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgbf8eb53">
<h4 id="orgbf8eb53"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.2</span> Beauvoir's thesis</h4>
<ul>
<li>Men consider themselves superior to women because they take away life from others instead of giving it.</li>
<li>As men became free and a subject, women became everything that men was not, and thus their selfdom became a threat.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgb3d11ba">
<h4 id="orgb3d11ba"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.3</span> The myth of the ideal woman</h4>
<ul>
<li>Women are idealized in literature as a being that should sacrifice herself when her spouse needs it.
<ul>
<li>[Is not that considered a virtue for men, too?]</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Women's bodies are disguised artificially so that they hide it's nature, which reminds men of the beginning and specially the end of life.
<ul>
<li>The image hammered through all sort of media is one that impedes women's creative capabilities.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>The worst part is that women have internalized this and do not even think that this can change, due to how pervasive is in our society.
<ul>
<li>Something that shows how common is women's objectification is <i>catcalling</i> and <i>whistling</i>.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-org045c28e">
<h4 id="org045c28e"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.4</span> The female roles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Roles are the main tool used to limit women's life:
<ul>
<li><i><b>Wife</b></i>: this institution reduces the deep and free bond of love into a formalized and routinary obligation, which narrows her world.</li>
<li><i><b>Mother</b></i>: at first having a child is liberating, as women have someone to turn into an other; but soon enough the child's necessities turn the mother into an other once again.</li>
<li><i><b>Career woman</b></i>: she has to both keep up with work and with social expectations towards her looks, which prevent her from concentrating on her career.</li>
<li><i><b>Prostitute</b></i>: They are treated as mere objects, as others, but in their relationship with men they have the upper hand: men both look for them and pay them for their encounters.</li>
<li><i><b>Narcissist</b></i>: Having begrudgingly accepted that they must be an object, some women turn all their attention to themselves and their looks, becoming self-absorbed.</li>
<li><i><b>Mystic</b></i>: This role tries to sublimate narcissism by becoming the sole object of an omnipotent subject's attention.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org3be18a5">
<h4 id="org3be18a5"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.5</span> Paths to freedom :D</h4>
<ul>
<li>None of these roles were made by women, rather being imposed on them by men. But, as there are no essences, things d not have to (and should not) stay this way.</li>
<li>Women should strive to have careers, become intellectuals, advance the marxist revolution, and stop seeing themselves as <i>others</i>.</li>

<section id="slide-orge94c242">
<h4 id="orge94c242"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.1</span> Jean Bethke Elshtain's critiques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Using obscure language does not help to reach to as much women as we should aspire to.</li>
<li>Beauvoir's analyses of the body (specially <i>female</i>) is far too negative.
<ul>
<li>She is too harsh with pregnancy, in contrast with many pregnant women.</li>
<li>This negativity may come from her personal conflicts with aging, death, sexual urges, etc.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>The outright denigration of traditionally female attributes is a glorification of male ones.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org82a7101">
<h4 id="org82a7101"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.2</span> Responses to Elshtain</h4>
<ul>
<li>Even if her prose is obscure, Beauvoir received many letters from women of every social class thanking her.</li>
<li>Sure, Beauvoir was not a big fan of the body (be it male or female), but she was not as hardcore as Sartre.
<ul>
<li>She criticized American feminism for being so body-centered.</li>

<section id="slide-org53f8ffb">
<h4 id="org53f8ffb"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.1</span> The main tenets</h4>
<ul>
<li>Postmodern feminism asks why women is the other, rather than why it is the second sex.</li>
<li>Maybe being the other is not that bad: you are in a better position to critique society from a pluralistic, open and diverse point of view.</li>
<li>In general it rejects phallogocentrism: no absolute word (<i>logos</i>), no emphasis on male perspective, no single solution.
<ul>
<li>Thus women's situation and it's solution is not <i>only one</i>.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Tong takes Hélène Cixous (inspired on Derrida) and Judith Butler (inspired on Foucault) as main examples of postmodern feminist thought.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgf0bb9bc">
<h4 id="orgf0bb9bc"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.2</span> The postmodern anticreed</h4>
<ol>
<li>We are creatures that can know how and why we think like we do.</li>
<li>Through reason we can acquire objective and universal knowledge.</li>
<li>Our knowledge captures the unchanging nature of reality (i. e. our knowledge is true).</li>
<li>Reason does not depend on history or time and space.</li>
<li>Reason, freedom, and autonomy relate closely to one another.</li>
<li>Reason is above power, so it always chooses truth when they conflict.</li>
<li>Science is the template for all knowledge, being neutral, objective, and useful.</li>
<li>Language reflects and refers to corresponding objects that our reason finds in the world.</li>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="slide-org27dd7c9">
<h4 id="org27dd7c9"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.3</span> Jacques Derrida</h4>
<ul>
<li>To become a member of a society one must internalize its symbolic order: gender, race, class norms, etc.</li>
<li>Nothing but language: Derrida uses deconstruction to show that language is holistic.
<ul>
<li>Also, words get it's meaning in relation not to one but to many other words.</li>
<li>A word's meaning comes not from an idea or essence, but from one of many readings and interpretations that the subject can make with it.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orge103e71">
<h4 id="orge103e71"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.4</span> Hélène Cixous: It's a matter of writing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cixous criticizes male literary style for being binary: action-passion, culture-nature, sun-moon, etc-etc.</li>
<li>Thus emerges the dyad man-woman, the first being related to positive things, the second to negative things.</li>
<li>Women should construct a new world (bringing change wit it) by writing in their style that which men leaves aside.
<ul>
<li>Woman's writing: marking, scratching, scribbling, jotting down.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Woman's writing reflects her sexuality: it's diverse, not ruled by strict norms, and open to explore.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgddf698c">
<h4 id="orgddf698c"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.5</span> Michel Foucault: on power</h4>
<ol>
<li>Power is coextensive with the social body;</li>
<li>relations of power are interwoven with other kinds of relations: production, kinship, family, sexuality;</li>
<li>power does not take the sole form of prohibition and punishment, but is multiple in form;</li>
<li>interconnections of power delineate general conditions of domination organized in a more or less coherent and unitary strategy;</li>
<li>power relations serve because they are capable of being utilised in a wide range of strategies;</li>
<li>there are no relations of power without possible resistances. (in Tong, p. 198)</li>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="slide-org0589355">
<h4 id="org0589355"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.6</span> Foucault: on power relationships</h4>
<ul>
<li>We live within a web of power relationships: those of sanity, violence and sexuality.</li>
<li>In sex we are policed by many figures, such as the psychiatrist, the priest, the lover, etc.</li>
<li>This relationships and their narratives become internalized, so people see their sexuality and their body according to them.
<ul>
<li>An example is cosmetic surgery, which defines, subjugates and limits women to their appearance.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-orge0de8a3">
<h4 id="orge0de8a3"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.7</span> Judith Butler: life in a grid</h4>
<ul>
<li>As Beauvoir, Butler thinks one is not born a woman, but becomes one.
<ul>
<li>Gender is something we build out of all the social norms we receive in foucaultian fashion.</li>
<li>Thus, gender is not something we can create out of thin air: we must work with what society gives us.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>We seem to be trapped in this boy-girl grid since birth, and the most we can do is to alter them <i>just a little</i>.
<ul>
<li>Nussbaum criticizes this, as to bring real change more is needed than the mere personal change.</li>
<li>Nussbaum also disagrees about the importance of sexual pleasure, as helping others seems more important [at an existential level].</li>
<li>Maybe in response to Nussbaum, Butler has taken a clearer position towards the importance of action based on the theory.</li>

<h4 id="org3fd3a2d"><span class="section-number-4">3.2.1</span> Excuse me, what?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Many people criticize postmodern feminist writers for their obscure style.
<ul>
<li>Butler won the first prize in 1998 on the <i>Bad Writing Contest</i>. Yep.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>
<p>
<i>The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.</i> (Tong, p. 204)

<ul>
<li>Essences and bodies (Elizabeth Grosz's reading)
<ul>
<li>Egalitarian feminism undervalued traditional female values in favor of male ones, and ignored the specific reproductive and sexual identities of the female body.</li>
<li>Difference (postmodern) feminism takes the female body and it's implications in a positive light and sees it as something that can be liberating, given the right social recognition.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>But many feminist do not like this approach, as it seems to view femaleness as some kind of <i>real</i> essence.
<ul>
<li>Some postmodern feminist answer ascribing to some form of nominalism, so that "female" is just a name for contingent properties.</li>
<li>To avoid separating all women from one another, it has been proposed that gender should be interpreted as a shared position from which to interpret our experience.</li>

<ul>
<li>Both existentialist and postmodern feminism share their interest in concepts such as nothingness, absence, the marginal, the peripheral, the repressed, the other, the Second Sex.</li>
