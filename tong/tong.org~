* Semana 4, 12 de agosto: Alison and Wollstonecraft
** Alison Jaggar
  - Sexual equality:
    - To be just/fair isn't something clear
    - Those of one sex of another shouldn't be different compared o the other (either better or worse) in virtue of their sex.
  - Sexism as an institution: women are expected to follow some roles, otherwise being punished by society
  - Jaggar: Women should be treated as a person rather than as a woman. Sex should be irrelevant
  - Others say that difference in sex should be recognized,
  - Are persons necessarily sexual?
    - Some say sex is a fundamental characteristic of everyone: as we are embodied, we do have a sex.
      - Persons have a sex, so denying sexuality is denying personhood
      - J: But even non-humans can be persons, so nope
    - In the practical sphere the sexual distinction is impossible to ignore.
      - Meh, we could ignore all of this except in regards to reproductions
  - Rights of women

** Pensamientos
I had a lot of different ideas reading this text, as interesting as all the others we have read. One of the main ones was this "aha!" moment about American liberalism. For an outsider, it seems quite curious why they tend to join all struggles into one. Most American liberals, so it seems to me, have a mentality of "all in or all out", in which if you do not agree with everything, you do not belong in the movement. The recent case of J. K. Rowling is a good example. The history covered by Davis in these chapters was illuminating in that regard, as it shows how closely related were the female and black liberation movements (even though there were cracks). The results of her historical analyses are really good.

But I have this awkward feeling about her approach, and I think it is because of the way she approaches history. Something that astonished me was the absence of almost any mention of God, who only made an appearance towards the end to ridicule the religious hypocrisy of male supremacist. I think this would not have been problematic if Davis had not mentioned that two women in the abolitionist movement were quackers (which, as far as I know, is more of a religion than an ethnicity), and then said that all their strength was drawn from the black community. For details like this one I had the feeling that Davis approach was trying to avoid mentioning that these women tended to agree with ideas that are now considered conservative, as we seem to find in other sources. But if we take this into account, then it becomes difficult to say that feminism and liberalism have a history, that many generations have fought for (not with the aforementioned mentality).

DEADLINE: <2020-09-02 mié> SCHEDULED: <2020-08-30 dom>
This reading was also interesting, but I have to admit that I had to drag myself through most of it. I think this was in part due to hooks' approach to the topics and the way in which she writes. 

Something that I disliked about this text is that hooks' point of view is defined by identity politics (or at least seems like it is). All the discussions are presented by first talking about broad groups and then mentioning some individuals that serve as no more then instances of said group. I feel this leads to a lot of categorical statements, as for example the assumption that everyone is racist until proven innocent, or that all white feminist excluded black women to perpetuate their social status. I think this is the reason why hooks is not very forgiving with most 19th century figures, who end up being condemned more than appreciated for any contributions that they could have made. As an external onlooker it just sounds strange that black women's problems are so particular to them that a movement that did bring /some/ improvement on women's status did more harm than good.

This last one thing confused me throughout most of the reading. It is probably due to the fact that we skipped some chapters, bit it was not clear to me how black women's problems are an altogether different category, instead of the combination of the problems that blacks and women face.

Something that I really liked was hooks' posture towards change. As she stated more or less at the end of both chapters, it is something that will come rather slowly, although this is no reason to shy away from action. Also, it is in everyone's hands to take responsibility to end both racism and sexism.

*** Existentialist feminism
**** Sartre's Philosophy
***** Ways of being
- /Being-for-itself/: The conscious life that humans have.
  - The consciousness, which is not a thing but still is.
- /Being-in-itself/: The material, animal-like humans have.
  - The body, which can be accessed and works like an object.
- /Being-for-others/: a mode of being in relation to other for-itselfs.
  - It implies a state of conflict, as establishing oneself as a self implies making everyone else an object.
***** Freedom is a curse
- /We are condemned to be free:/
  - That's why we have the /human condition/, not a /human essence/.
- We are born being nothingness, and through election we define ourselves (eliminating possibilities).
- We thus tend to have /bad faith:/
  - We try to escape this state of freedom by imitating objects and just being a role (e. g. a waiter, ignoring someone is taking my hand).
- But this bad faith has two problems:
  - The for-itself can never become the in-itself (unless it dies).
  - Bad faith tries to avoid responsibility, which is what makes our freedom meaningful.
***** Existence's  infinite [-ish] cycle of misery [wtf?]
- Being-for-others and it's manifestations are useful concepts for feminist thought:
  - */Love/*: we desire to be both ourselves and the other, but we end up rejecting our subjectivity and trying to become objects for the other (masochism).
  - */Indifference/*: we try to ignore other people (as if they did not exist or could not determine us), until someone else irrupts in our life.
  - */Desire/*: we try to reduce the other to it's flesh, so that we can make sexual use of it, but when we achieve that we realize we wanted it as a subject (sadism).
  - */Hate/*: when the other does not submit to us as subject, and thus we feel ridiculed or vilified in the other's eyes, we want to destroy them all.
**** Feminism and existentialism (mainly Beauvoir)
***** Men as /self/, women as /other/
- For men to be /selves/, they have to subjugate the /other/, which are women.
  - This relations is particular in it's universality and in being internalized by women.
- Facts must be interpreted:
  - /*Biology*/: The fact that women might be weaker/more passive than men biologically does not justify reducing them to an /in-itself/.
  - /*Psychoanalysis*/: Even though sexuality is an important factor for human beings, women's subjugation is not due to their lack of male genitalia.
  - /*Marxism*/: The fact that women's traditional labor is not recognized is irrelevant compared with men's tendency to dominate the other.
***** Beauvoir's thesis
- Men consider themselves superior to women because they take away life from others instead of giving it.
- As men became free and a subject, women became everything that men was not, and thus their selfdom became a threat.
***** The myth of the ideal woman
- Women are idealized in literature as a being that should sacrifice herself when her spouse needs it.
  - [Is not that considered a virtue for men, too?]
- Women's bodies are disguised artificially so that they hide it's nature, which reminds men of the beginning and specially the end of life.
  - The image hammered through all sort of media is one that impedes women's creative capabilities.
- The worst part is that women have internalized this and do not even think that this can change, due to how pervasive is in our society.
  - Something that shows how common is women's objectification is /catcalling/ and /whistling/.
***** The female roles
- Roles are the main tool used to limit women's life:
  - /*Wife*/: this institution reduces the deep and free bond of love into a formalized and routinary obligation, which narrows her world.
  - /*Mother*/: at first having a child is liberating, as women have someone to turn into an other; but soon enough the child's necessities turn the mother into an other once again.
  - /*Career woman*/: she has to both keep up with work and with social expectations towards her looks, which prevent her from concentrating on her career.
  - /*Prostitute*/: They are treated as mere objects, as others, but in their relationship with men they have the upper hand: men both look for them and pay them for their encounters.
  - /*Narcissist*/: Having begrudgingly accepted that they must be an object, some women turn all their attention to themselves and their looks, becoming self-absorbed.
  - /*Mystic*/: This role tries to sublimate narcissism by becoming the sole object of an omnipotent subject's attention.
***** Paths to freedom :D
- None of these roles were made by women, rather being imposed on them by men. But, as there are no essences, things d not have to (and should not) stay this way.
- Women should strive to have careers, become intellectuals, advance the marxist revolution, and stop seeing themselves as /others/.
**** A feminist criticism of Beauvoir
***** Jean Bethke Elshtain's critiques
- Using obscure language does not help to reach to as much women as we should aspire to.
- Beauvoir's analyses of the body (specially /female/) is far too negative.
  - She is too harsh with pregnancy, in contrast with many pregnant women.
  - This negativity may come from her personal conflicts with aging, death, sexual urges, etc.
- The outright denigration of traditionally female attributes is a glorification of male ones.
***** Responses to Elshtain
- Even if the prose is obscure, Beauvoir received many letters from women of every social class thanking her.
- Sure, Beauvoir was not a big fan of the body (be it male or female), but she was not as hardcore as Sartre.
  - She criticized American feminism for being so body-centered.
*** Postmodern feminism
**** The postmodern point of view
***** The main tenets
- Postmodern feminism asks why women is the other, rather than why it is the second sex.
- Maybe being the other is not that bad: you are in a better position to critique society from a pluralistic, open and diverse point of view.
- In general it rejects phallogocentrism: no absolute word (/logos/), no emphasis on male perspective, no single solution.
  - Thus women's situation and it's solution is not /only one/.
- Tong takes Hélène Cixous (inspired on Derrida) and Judith Butler (inspired on Foucault) as main examples of postmodern feminist thought.
***** The postmodern anticreed
1. We are creatures that can know how and why we think like we do.
2. Through reason we can acquire objective and universal knowledge.
3. Our knowledge captures the unchanging nature of reality (i. e. our knowledge is true).
4. Reason does not depend on history or time and space.
5. Reason, freedom, and autonomy relate closely to one another.
6. Reason is above power, so it always chooses truth when they conflict.
7. Science is the template for all knowledge, being neutral, objective, and useful.
8. Language reflects and refers to corresponding objects that our reason finds in the world.
***** Jacques Derrida
- To become a member of a society one must internalize its symbolic order: gender, race, class norms, etc.
- Nothing but language: Derrida uses deconstruction to show that language is holistic.
  - Also, words get it's meaning in relation not to one but to many other words.
  - A word's meaning comes not from an idea or essence, but from one of many readings and interpretations that the subject can make with it.
***** Hélène Cixous: It's a matter of writing
- Cixous criticizes male literary style for being binary: action-passion, culture-nature, sun-moon, etc-etc.
- Thus emerges the dyad man-woman, the first being related to positive things, the second to negative things.
- Women should construct a new world (bringing change wit it) by writing in their style that which men leaves aside.
  - Woman's writing: marking, scratching, scribbling, jotting down.
- Woman's writing reflects her sexuality: it's diverse, not ruled by strict norms, and open to explore.
***** Michel Foucault: on power
1. Power is coextensive with the social body;
2. relations of power are interwoven with other kinds of relations: production, kinship, family, sexuality;
3. power does not take the sole form of prohibition and punishment, but is multiple in form;
4. interconnections of power delineate general conditions of domination organized in a more or less coherent and unitary strategy;
5. power relations serve because they are capable of being utilised in a wide range of strategies;
6. there are no relations of power without possible resistances. (in Tong, p. 198)
***** Foucault: on power relationships
- We live within a web of power relationships: those of sanity, violence and sexuality.
- In sex we are policed by many figures, such as the psychiatrist, the priest, the lover, etc.
- This relationships and their narratives become internalized, so people see their sexuality and their body according to them.
  - An example is cosmetic surgery, which defines, subjugates and limits women to their appearance.
***** Judith Butler: life in a grid
- As Beauvoir, Butler thinks one is not born a woman, but becomes one.
  - Gender is something we build out of all the social norms we receive in foucaultian fashion.
  - Thus, gender is not something we can create out of thin air: we must work with what society gives us.
- We seem to be trapped in this boy-girl grid since birth, and the most we can do is to alter them /just a little/.
  - Nussbaum criticizes this, as to bring real change more is needed than the mere personal change.
  - Nussbaum also disagrees about the importance of sexual pleasure, as helping others seems more important [at an existential level].
  - Maybe in response to Nussbaum, Butler has taken a clearer position towards the importance of action based on the theory.
**** Criticism of postmodern feminism
*****  Excuse me, what?
- Many people criticize postmodern feminist writers for their obscure style.
  - Butler won the first prize in 1998 on the /Bad Writing Contest/. Yep.
/The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power./ (Tong, p. 204)
***** The heresy of essentialism
- Essences and bodies (Elizabeth Grosz's reading)
  - Egalitarian feminism undervalued traditional female values in favor of male ones, and ignored the specific reproductive and sexual identities of the female body.
  - Difference (postmodern) feminism takes the female body and it's implications in a positive light and sees it as something that can be liberating, given the right social recognition.
- But many feminist do not like this approach, as it seems to view femaleness as some kind of /real/ essence.
  - Some postmodern feminist answer ascribing to some form of nominalism, so that "female" is just a name for contingent properties.
  - To avoid separating all women from one another, it has been proposed that gender should be interpreted as a shared position from which to interpret our experience.
*** Tong's conclusions
- Both existentialist and postmodern feminism share their interest in concepts such as nothingness, absence, the marginal, the peripheral, the repressed, the other, the Second Sex.
- Gender may not be something entirely negative, as it gives points of view and the possibility of different voices (something that we may not fully understand yet).
*** [My] questions
- How much does Beauvoir's proposals depend on Sartre's? Could we have a beauvoirdian philosophy without sartrean ideas?
- Are men blind to catcalling, or the catcallers do it when they can not be heard/seen by other men?
